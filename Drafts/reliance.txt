Diesel, Sulphur, Coke, Polypropylene, and a number of aromatic products including Paraxylene, Orthoxylene and Benzene.

Reliance Industries Limited, after having successfully commissioned its 2nd mega grass root refining complex under Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Jamnagar, is considering several value creation projects leveraging the streams of both the refineries.

The J3 will comprise multiple new processing units, located within the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) and Special Economic Zone (SEZ) with integration / modifications to the existing refineries. The two major projects are the Ethylene and downstream complex (C2 Complex), and the Gasification and associated projects.

Other items in the development include: Offsites, Utilities, CPP, seawater intake, pipelines, tank farm, marine facilities etc.

# **7 Site information**

### **7.1 Site data**

The site is located at latitude 22o 22' N, longitude 69o 51' E adjacent to the town of Jamnagar in Gujarat State alongside the Gulf of Kutch approximately 480 km north of Bombay on India's west coast. The J3 Projects Site is located just to the south of the State Highway No.25 to Jamnagar. The nearest major commercial airport and port is Mumbai, however a dedicated Material Offloading Facility (MOF) was constructed for the original development.

The site is operational. The Marine Terminal / Tank Farm are located on a flat area of coastal scrub land covered with grass and small bushes. The weathered rock is close to the surface approximately 0.5 to 1.5 metres down.

The water table closely follows the surface undulations at approximately 2 metres down, with water wells present on the site. The rubble causeway crosses salt and mud flats until the depth of water and berthing requirements dictates a change to a piled trestle jetty founded on weathered rock. A salt laden coastal atmosphere shall be considered as normal expected environment.

Plant North is true North for the whole project except for the Marine Terminal and Marine Tank Farm which have a plant north that is 16o to the West of true North.

- A single lane metalled road (Highway 25)
- A branch line from the railway which connects Kanalus and Sikka.
- An MOF comprising one or more jetties to enable the import of construction materials and equipment.

![](_page_21_Picture_0.jpeg)

• Data relating to the Capacity and size and limitations relating to loads for Rail, Road and Jetty will be established during design evolution of J3 projects.

# **8 Utility Information**

### **8.1 General**

J3 projects Utilities generation systems shall be evolved as more information is available from Process Licensors' as to utilities requirements for process plants. Design principles are outlined on similar lines with existing installations at DTA and SEZ refineries.

J3 projects will generate all secondary utilities from sea water and coke and imported natural gas.

Utilities systems will be integrated with corresponding DTA refinery or SEZ refinery utilities systems.

Layout shall have provision for future modular units, from which appropriate tie-ins for future equipment may be made.

### **8.2 Utilities distribution**

All ISBL utility distribution systems are to be sized for 10% greater capacity than the estimated design requirement except in case of cooling water networks that should be designed for 20% greater capacity than the estimated design requirement. OSBL utility distribution headers are to be sized for the greater of

- a) 120% of Design Flow which is the sum of the process unit design flows (maximum operating load) on the header or
- b) 110% of Maximum Flow which is the sum of process unit design flows on the header plus the largest difference between a process unit design and its maximum flow.

### **8.3 Sea Water System**

Sea water will be pumped from an intake system to an RO unit located on the coast near the Marine Terminal. Sea water will be filtered to remove turbidity to meet the requirements of desalination unit. Sludge from the sea water filtration unit will be disposed of in a manner consistent with environmental norms and considering current practices.The sea water will be chlorinated to control biological fouling.

The sea water supply lines are to be sized to cater for the maximum flow rate of the sea water intake basin.

In J3 projects, sea water will be used for the following purposes:

![](_page_22_Picture_0.jpeg)

- As a feed for the Sea Water RO Desalination Units
- As make-up water for the Sea water cooling towers

Specification for seawater is included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3. These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses. Return sea water from the desalination units and the sea water cooling towers will be returned to the sea at appropriate distance and depth into the sea, through suitably designed outfall system. The system will ensure diffusion as per practices earlier adopted for DTA and SEZ refineries.

### **8.4 Desalinated Water System**

The J3 projects will have an RO unit for sea water desalination. This will be located in MTF within DTA refinery.

Desalinated water will be used as:

- Supplementary make-up water in the process cooling towers
- Feed for the DMW system
- Supplementary feed for the potable / utility water system
- One of the feeds for the fire water system

DTA refinery and SEZ refinery currently use the multi-effect distillation (MED) process with filtered sea water from MTF as feed. The cooling water for the Desalination Unit is from the sea water.

Specifications for desalinated water streams are included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3. These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses.

#### **8.5 Cooling water systems**

The J3 projects will use open recirculating type cooling towers as in DTA and SEZ refineries. Number of cooling towers will be installed in the overall plot space each serving a group of process units.

As in DTA and the SEZ refineries, there may be principally two types of cooling water systems:

- The fresh water cooling system (normally DSW / LTDS, but some individual towers may be supplied by LTDS only)
- The sea water cooling system

![](_page_23_Picture_0.jpeg)

Specification for make-up water is included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3. These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses.

### **8.6 Water Systems for Process Use**

The J3 will have its own separate water systems for process use. DM water can be used directly in Process plants or as make-up to Boiler feed water.

J3 will have three BFW systems supplying to process units with HP, MP and LP BFW.

The process BFW systems can preferentially use recovered process condensate as makeup water to the Process Deaerators with DMW used to make up any shortfall.

Specification for BFW is included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3. These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses.

### **8.7 Potable water and Service water**

DSW from RO unit will preferentially be used as potable water once it has been treated in the Passivation and Chlorination Units.

The plant's service water system is fed with raw water with supplementary make-up from potable water. The safety showers and eye-wash stations shall be supplied with potable water and the exposed metal lines shall be insulated to avoid heating of stagnant water by solar radiation.

Specification for potable water and service water are included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3. These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses.

#### **8.8 Fire water systems**

Existing fire water systems shall be extended for J3 Process units, the tank farm, the marine tank farm and the jetty except in the case of plants located east of railway line. The fire water systems will use raw water / desalinated water as both initial fill and make-up water during fire-fighting except in the case of marine tank-farm area where initial fill will be with desalinated water and sea water will be used during fire-fighting.

Specification for Fire water is included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3. These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses.

The fire water network should be designed based on the tallest tower in the complex or additional booster pumps are to be provided for ISBL sections having tall towers.

![](_page_24_Picture_0.jpeg)

The fire water lines should be preferably laid underground. In case fire water lines are laid aboveground, these shall be laid out in a manner so as not to be exposed to any blast intensity beyond 0.35 psi.

### **8.9 The Steam and Condensate System**

### **8.9.1 Steam system**

The J3 projects will have their own separate steam and condensate systems. These systems will be integrated with DTA and SEZ refinery systems.

In J3, steam will be available on-site at HHP, HP, MP and LP steam conditions. HHP steam and HP steam will be used to drive turbines, in the process reducing the HHP steam to HP, MP and LP steam, which will then be distributed to the rest of the J3 complex. HP steam can also be used to drive smaller turbines.

The temperatures and pressures of each level shown in Attachment 3 reflect the conditions at the battery limit of consumer plants. The OSBL designer shall ensure that these parameters are satisfied.

### **8.9.2 Steam Conditions**

Systems are identified in general terms such as High High Pressure (HHP), High Pressure (HP), Medium Pressure (MP), Low Pressure (LP), etc., or as nominal pressure levels, or in any other suitable terms.

#### Definitions:

- MINIMUM describes the lowest steam pressure and temperature expected inside the process battery limits during normal operation.
- NORMAL describes the average or typical steam pressure and temperature expected at the process battery limit during normal operation.
- MAXIMUM describes the highest steam pressure and temperature expected inside the process battery limits during normal (non-relieving) operation.
- DESIGN describes pressures and temperatures used for the mechanical design of piping and equipment - excluding steam generation equipment designed under the provisions of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section I. These conditions are particularly important if matching existing equipment or design is done by others.

#### Methodology of how this information is to be used:

• Steam consuming equipment connected to a steam header will in general be specified based upon the minimum steam conditions and reviewed for satisfactory operation anywhere between the maximum and minimum steam header conditions.

![](_page_25_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Normal steam conditions will be used for utility estimates, heat and mass balances, etc.
- Steam generating equipment connected to a steam header will in general be specified based upon the maximum steam conditions and reviewed for satisfactory operation anywhere between the maximum and minimum steam header conditions.
- Design conditions will be considered to establish relief valve set pressures and mechanical design.

### Steamout Conditions

• Hydrocarbon lines and vessels in the process area should be checked for steam-out conditions of 0.5 kg/ cm2 a at 150°C, when specified for steam-out conditions in the vessel data sheet or line sheet.

### **8.9.3 Condensate system**

In J3 complex, when used as a heating medium HP steam will be condensed and then flashed to MP conditions. Also, the steam traps on the HP network discharge to the MP network. This process is repeated for MP and LP steam until LP condensate is produced (at atmospheric conditions).

In the J3 complex, recovered polished condensate will be used as feed water for the Process BFW system which is used in the process steam generators. In J3 complex, demineralised water shall be used to make up any deficiency of process condensate for both the Process and CPP BFW systems. Contaminated condensate will be diverted to the low TDS effluent system.

Specification for steam and condensate are included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3.

### **8.10 Fuel Gas System (HOLD)**

Off-gases from DTA and SEZ refineries will be collected and routed to the C2 complex. At C2 complex, available ethylene will be recovered and rest of the gas stream will be passed through cracking furnaces for production of additional quantity of ethylene.

Part of the fuel gas will be utilized for the C2 complex and a return fuel gas stream, rich in nitrogen, shall return to DTA refinery.

The J3 complex will be supplied with Natural Gas via a pipeline.

A central fuel gas collection drum will act as a mixing vessel and a knock-out pot to remove any entrained or condensed liquid in the fuel gas. Any excess liquid in this drum will be drained to the low pressure flare.

In the event of low pressure in the fuel gas network, a steam heated vaporiser will evaporate LPG into the system. Dual fired burners are to burn as much fuel oil (in

![](_page_26_Picture_0.jpeg)

preference to fuel gas) as is practicable whenever a low pressure situation develops in the fuel gas system. Normal firing for these heaters is fuel gas.

The quality of the fuel gas will be variable depending on the operating capacity and number of other parameters in the J3 complex. Indicative specification for fuel gas and syn gas and natural gas are included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3. These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses.

### **8.11 Syn Gas from Gasifiers (HOLD)**

Syn Gas from gasifiers will be scrubbed, purified and sent to OSBL. From OSBL, the gas will be routed to GTs (new and existing) and also linked to lower pressure Fuel gas system. In future, the Syngas system will have other linkages for process uses.

### **8.12 Fuel Oil System**

Use of Fuel oil is not envisaged in the J3 complex.

### **8.13 Power plant**

Equipment for power generation, are proposed to be arranged in C2 complex and Gasification complex along with HRSGs and Auxiliary boilers. These machines will generate power at 14.5 KV and 11 kv levels and be integrated with existing generators at 220 kv level.

Brief specifications of power are furnished in Attachment 2. Attachment 3 indicates typical voltage levels.

### **8.13.1 Emergency power system**

Emergency power requirements of the individual process unit, in case of power failure in the respective units, or total blackout will be catered from Distributed generation of Emergency power through Diesel Generator sets which will be provided at strategic locations to cover one or more of the process units.

Emergency power will be distributed to a group of plant from DG sets at 415 Volts (3phase+N) or 6600 Volts 3 Phase depending on the quantum of emergency power requirements.

### **8.13.2 Uninterrupted power supply (HOLD)**

Singe phase uninterrupted power will be supplied to critical instrumentation and control systems by 110 V AC Invertors with battery backup of 30 minutes. It is envisaged that emergency DG sets will be available within 30 minutes and supply power to UPS system. UPS system will have No break static transfer switches to ensure uninterrupted power to critical instrumentation and control system.

![](_page_27_Picture_0.jpeg)

### 8.14 Air System

The J3 projects will have their own separate air systems. The instrument and plant air are likely to be generated at three locations, a) Gasification DTA b) Gasification SEZ and c) C2 complex.

All plants provide oil free, water saturated plant air and oil free instrument air with a water dew point of -40°C at normal supply pressure.

Volumetric capacity equal to 20 minutes normal consumption of instrument air will be incorporated into the system to provide safe shutdown on loss of instrument air from source. This will be achieved using a high pressure dry air storage vessel with 'hold-up' volume of 20 minutes normal consumption between 40 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>g and 6 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>g.

Specification for plant and instrument air and breathing air are included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3.

### 8.15 Nitrogen System (HOLD)

Major nitrogen generators in the J3 complex will be ASUs associated with EO/EG unit in C2 complex and ASUs associated with Gasification units in DTA and SEZ Gasification areas. Definition of these facilities is in progress.

In the ASUs associated with Gasification units, Nitrogen will be produced by a cryogenic air separation process in both gaseous and liquid forms. Some liquid nitrogen will be stored local to the cryogenic plant for use as nitrogen back-up in times of excessive demand e.g. start up and tank inbreathing in the tank farms.

The high purity nitrogen will be dry, oil free and 99.998 vol% pure. Oxygen contamination is to be kept below 10 ppm v/v.

Lower purity gaseous nitrogen from these units will be compressed and routed to GTs as diluents for NOx reduction.

Units that require higher purity nitrogen, for example LDPE and LLDPE in the C2 complex, will be supplied Gaseous Nitrogen (GAN) from ASU to be located in EO/EG plant. ASU at EO EG Plant will supply high purity Nitrogen with  $O_2$  content of less than 5 ppm at 7.7 Barg.

Specifications for nitrogen are included in the table in Attachment 2.

Typical battery limit pressures and temperatures are indicated in Attachment 3.

These numbers will be firmed up as system design progresses.

# **9 Equipment design considerations**

#### **9.1 Equipment sparing**

#### **9.1.1 ISBL static equipment / packages**

Typically, items of static equipment in individual units are not spared. One exception would be adsorption units and similar installations that may require periodic regeneration and the operating bed has a spare that is regenerated and kept ready to maintain continuity of operation.

#### **9.1.2 Continuous rotary equipment**

All continuous running pumps and reciprocating compressors shall have installed spare. In critical compression applications, the complete package inclusive of compressor, turbine, expander, motor, gearbox and auxiliary system shall be in compliance to relevant project specification (referenced to relevant API standards). In certain packages, vendor standard equipment may be accepted on case to case basis.

In certain critical compression applications, machines with split capacity can be explored. For critical agitators, warehouse spare rotor should be considered.

### **9.1.3 Non-critical / non-continuous rotary equipment**

For intermittent services, sparing philosophy shall be decided from case to case basis.

### **9.1.4 OSBL ultra critical packages**

The common facilities, OSBL of all process units house installations that serve many units and discontinuation / disruption can have economic repercussions and may also create safety issues at other parts of the complex.

These packages, for example Power and steam generation systems, Air compression system, Nitrogen generation system and similar installations are typically planned with one spare module so as to ensure continuity of supply in spite of outage or maintenance.

In certain packages, for example ETP, sparing is at sub-assembly level rather than the entire unit.

Provision of spare knock out drum and flare stack can be considered where the complex never completely shuts down. This is expected to be the case for J3 Complex.

#### **9.2 Equipment overdesign**

Equipment sizing shall be carried out at the larger flowrate from the following alternates:

1. Percentage higher flow recommended by Licensor for equipment sizing, over the controlling case steady state flow rate on PFD / Heat and Material Balance

- 2. Ten percent higher flow over the controlling case steady state flow rate on PFD / Heat and Material Balance.
  - a. However, if controlling case is not for current operation, but is for future proofing purpose, such margin need not exceed 5%.
- 3. The percentage higher flow rate recommended by empowered representatives of RIL over the controlling case steady state flow on PFD / Heat and Material Balance.
  - a. In case, this percentage is higher than alternates 1 and 2, the justification shall be documented.

### **9.3.1 Automatic Remote Isolation Valves**

- 1. Automatic remote isolation valves shall be considered between process vessels and pumps with mechanical seals, in the following applications. The closure of these valves shall result in the automatic shutdown of the corresponding pumps.
  - Upstream vessel / tank inventory is 7.5m3 or more of n-butane or lighter hydrocarbons
  - Upstream vessel / tank inventory is 50m3 or more of C5 or heavier hydrocarbons in order to isolate large inventories where pump seal failure could result in large uncontrollable releases.
  - Where the vessel contents are at temperatures higher than the auto-ignition temperature or at temperatures above 250 degree C (600 degree F as per API 553.
- 2. In non-pumped systems, remote isolation valves are to be provisioned for similar applications as in case of pumped systems (point 1 above).
- 3. At major lines entering or leaving a system of vessels, containing more than 4.5 tons of flammable chemicals, which operate together to perform a unit operation such as distillation, refrigeration or reaction. For example in an ethylene plant, an automatic remote isolation valve is often installed in the feed line to a distillation unit and another automatic remote isolation valve is installed in the outlet line from the unit to the next process unit

### **9.5 Determination of Design Temperature and Pressure**

The design internal pressure is set such that relief devices will activate only in emergency conditions and such that the relief devices will have adequate blow down margin. The design external pressure is set such that vacuum breaking devices are not required or such that vacuum relief devices will have adequate pressure drop to provide protection.

### **9.5.1 Design Internal Pressure (for pressure vessels)**

The design internal pressure is determined : a) for equipment (and piping) at discharge of pumps and compressors as explained below b) and c) for low pressure equipment where provisioning separate PSV is not economical as explained below d) from the maximum operating pressure, applying margins as in the following table.

a) In case the design pressure for pump / compressor discharge side is computed by adding maximum pump / compressor discharge head to the maximum suction pressure, additional margin is not required.

When using the approach of adding maximum of either, normal suction / maximum differential or maximum suction / normal differential, the margin from the table below should be applied. Computation of maximum differential head should account for frequency variation as appropriate.

b) Maximum pressure resulting from (potential) flow from a higher pressure system to a lower pressure system plus margin from table below (unless the lower pressure system is protected by a PSV).

![](_page_33_Picture_0.jpeg)

- c) Maximum cold liquid vapour pressure at ambient temperature plus margin from table below (unless economics dictates protecting the equipment with a relief valve set at lower pressure).
- d) Table for margin to be added to internal pressure

| Range of Maximum Operating Pressure                                           | Design Pressure                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vacuum to 1.8 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (25 psig)                                  | Typically 3.5 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (50 psig)                 |
| 1.8 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (25 psig) to 17.6 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (250 psig)    | Max. Operating Pressure + 1.8 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (25 psig) |
| 17.6 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (250 psig) to 35.2 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (500 psig)  | Max. Operating Pressure x 1.1                                |
| 35.2 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (500 psig) to 70.3 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (1000 psig) | Max. Operating Pressure + 3.5 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (50 psig) |
| Over 70.3 kg/cm <sup>2</sup> g (1000 psig)                                    | Max. Operating Pressure x 1.05                               |

#### Note 1

Maximum static head condition can be additive to margin from table above for items in Section (a) through Section (d) above.

For example the design pressure of reflux drums should be set sufficient high to ensure that when the column relief valves (that are protecting the system) are operating at full accumulation the static head of the flooded condenser (from the condenser relief valve to the reflux drum relief valve) should not lift the reflux drum fire relief valves.

#### Note 2

These margins are based upon "typical" relief valve blowdowns / simmer.

The design intent is to ensure that the reseating pressure and simmer pressure of the relief valve is higher than the vessel maximum pressure in its normal operation mode. Some relief valves, for instance those in vapour and liquid service, may have higher blowdowns and require

![](_page_34_Picture_0.jpeg)

additional margin. On the other hand, pilot relief valves have a small Blowdown and require a significantly smaller margin.

There may also be a reason to design with extra margin between operating and design pressure to minimize the likelihood of a relief valve opening, particularly if the fluid handled is toxic or produces a disposal problem when relieved.

Increasing the equipment design pressure (for example to 5.3 kg/cm2 g for low pressure equipment), may involve very small cost escalation for many equipment, (controlling case may be wind load / earthquake), but it can reduce the size of the corresponding PSV and associated relief system. Judgment will be exercised in these cases.

### **9.5.2 Design Temperature**

This section of the guideline shall be used for OSBL; for ISBL, licensors guideline shall be followed. Where not specified elsewhere in this document, the Design Temperature shall be 28 <sup>0</sup> C (50 <sup>0</sup> F) plus the coincidental temperature at the Design Pressure. The maximum design temperature determines the maximum allowable stress to be used for mechanical design of equipment. For temperatures beyond 3430 C (6500 F), the Design Temperature shall be 14 <sup>0</sup> C (25 <sup>0</sup> F) plus the coincidental temperature at the Design Pressure.

In cases where a temperature for a process upset scenario exceeds the maximum operating temperature plus 280 C (500 F) guideline, additional margin on the upset temperature is not required to set design temperature.

For equipment that may be under the purview of PESO, the minimum design temperature on the positive side shall not be less than 650 C.

## **9.5.3 Minimum Design Metal Temperature (MDMT)**

This section of the guideline shall be used for OSBL; for ISBL licensors guideline shall be followed).

The minimum design metal temperature for new design units is the most stringent of the following:

- The minimum ambient temperature less 5.6 o C (10<sup>o</sup> F).
- The minimum operating temperature less 5.6 <sup>o</sup> C (10o F).

![](_page_35_Picture_0.jpeg)

• The minimum equipment temperature caused by depressuring down to the constant superimposed back pressure of the flare header.

Note that in many cases (e.g. systems containing light hydrocarbons) the MDMT will likely be controlled by the depressuring criteria.

Note that the 5.6<sup>o</sup> C (10<sup>o</sup> F) margin is not applied to the minimum design metal temperature for depressuring.

It must also be noted that under conditions of depressuring, the equipment integrity needs to be ensured only for the maximum superimposed back pressure under conditions of depressuring without any reference to normal operating pressure inside the item of equipment (reference API RP 579 – Fitness for service).

## **9.5.4 Vacuum design**

Vacuum design condition is indicated for all equipment that normally operates under vacuum conditions, or is subjected to evacuation during startup, shutdown and regeneration.

Vacuum design is also specified for vessels which normally operate liquid full and that can be blocked in and cooled down, and for fractionators and associated equipment that can undergo a vacuum condition through the loss of heat input.

Steam condensers, steam reboilers or heaters, condensate pots, direct steam injection equipment to be designed for full vacuum.

Columns and vessels subjected to steam out to be designed for at least half vacuum (0.5 kg/cm2 a).

Equipment is not designed for full vacuum conditions due to blocking in after steam-out or any other operator mal-operation.

Where it is impractical to design low pressure equipment to accommodate vacuum conditions, (for example atmospheric tanks), the items of equipment are protected by drawing in air or nitrogen.

### **9.6 Material of Construction related issues**

Primary metallurgy for items of hardware exposed to process fluids shall be advised by the Licensor / BEC through Material Selection Diagram (MSD) and individual data sheets and P & IDs. These will be further elaborated and specified in detail with exact material grades by the DEC.

Metallurgy and corrosion allowance needs to be specified considering a 20-year life minimum.

### **9.6.1 Corrosion allowances**

Licensor recommendations will be the starting point for fixing corrosion allowances.

### For static equipment

| Material                                         | Minimum Corr.<br>allowance(CA) |  |

| Low Alloy Steel (above 2 ¼ % Cr and up to 9% Cr) | 1.5 mm                         |  |

#### Cladded equipment

Minimum thickness for cladding is 2 mm.

If equipment is cladded, thickness of cladding is considered as CA with minimum of 3 mm.

If equipment is overlaid, undiluted thickness of weld overlay is considered as CA with a minimum of 3 mm.

#### Storage Tanks

For storage tanks corrosion allowance shall be considered as 1.5 mm for shell and bottom. For roof, corrosion allowance shall be considered as 1 mm.

### **9.7.7 Heaters**

#### Process Issues + Sizing / Rating issues

Equipment design shall be based on final material balances with agreed overdesign margins. Physical properties used must have been validated.

#### Efficiency

Reasonably attainable heater efficiencies will vary with service, size of heater and quality of fuel.

![](_page_47_Picture_0.jpeg)

Based on the net heating value of fuel, the typical minimum target fuel efficiency is 91- 92% with air preheat & 89-90% minimum with steam generation for continuous operating heaters.

The basis for this fuel efficiency is 15% excess air for oil firing and 10% excess air for gas firing for the design case. The excess air can be lower with the low NOx burners. The monitoring will be through Oxygen analyzer at stack (target minimum 1.7% for gas firing and 2.5% for oil firing).

For the sizing of the heater, associated fans, ducting and air preheaters, higher level of excess air shall be considered (25% for oil firing and 15% for gas firing).

The efficiency figures can vary based on a number of factors and for a particular application, heater supplier will need to advice if efficiency improvement measures may not be justified in some case. The following table may be considered indicative only.

### Heat recovery

To achieve the target heater efficiency, Steam generation and Air Preheat is considered for the recovery of heat from the flue gas. See indicative table above.

Steam Generation in process heater convections is considered to be indirect steam generation and therefore can operate continuously for 2 years at a time.

#### Preheater type

Recuperative (stationary) type air preheater is normally used.

#### Combustion Air

Combustion air is to be supplied by a fan even when the air preheater is bypassed. Fan failure will result in shutdown of the heater.

A spare combustion air fan is specified (see note in table above abut need for simultaneous operation of spare fan).

A cold air bypass is provided for stack temperature control and for heater operation at 100% of normal duty with the air preheater bypassed.

Draft

A spare induced draft fan is not specified since the stack is considered to serve the purpose of a spare. If the induced draft fan fails, the air preheater bypass will open to divert flue gas to the stack.

NOx Emissions

Low NOx staged air burners are used for oil firing & Low NOx staged fuel burners are used for gas firing. The maximum NOx emission level shall be as per Indian statutory regulations.

Soot Blowers

Retractable soot blowers are installed in the convection coils wherever fuel oil firing or dual firing facility is available. MP Steam is used as the mobile carrier. For gas fired heaters space provision shall be made for future installation of soot blowers.

**9.7.8 Rotating Equipment** 

**9.7.8.1 Drives for critical rotary equipment** 

Critical service steam or power driven equipment is defined as equipment in that service which must be maintained in the event of power failure in order to protect personnel, equipment, or catalyst.

Critical equipment drive should be motor, with turbine driven spare, unless steam balance demands an extraction turbine for the main drive to avoid steam let down. Power is more reliable than Steam, as most of the steam comes from HRSG. For emergency steam, separate auxiliary boilers are to be provisioned. See also section 8.10.

Firewater pumps are 50% motor driven and 50% diesel engine driven. Spare lubricating circulation pump to critical equipment are motor driven.

### **9.7.8.2 Pumps**

#### Process Issues

Equipment design shall be based on final material balances with agreed overdesign margins. Physical properties used must have been validated.

Shutoff head of pump is to be minimum 105 % of rated point for single operation and 110 % of rated point for parallel operation as far as possible. Shutoff head of centrifugal pump is to be preferably limited to 120 % of head at rated point.

The NPSHr shall be lower than NPSHa by at least 1m throughout the range from minimum continuous stable flow to the rated capacity unless the data sheet / Specification dictate otherwise states. NPSHa shall be reference to the bottom of the base frame for horizontal pumps; the suction nozzle centre line for vertical pumps, and top of the foundation for vertically suspended pumps.

The margins to be maintained between pump required and available NPSH values are defined in the Pump specifications.

#### Mechanical Design

In general, the centrifugal pumps should be selected from following four categories:

- A. API Pumps
- B. Non-API Pumps
- C. Specially engineered pumps.
- D. Seal-less pumps.

#### **A. API Pumps:**

API pumps should be selected for following applications / conditions:

- All pumps in hydrocarbon processing plants. This would also include pumps in non-hazardous services such as Phenolic water, wash water, etc.
- Pumps having high criticality with respect to safety. Failure / break down of the pump or its components may cause serious safety hazard to personnel, plant or environment. Examples of such services are concentrated acids, liquid containing Hydrogen Sulphide, liquids at and above auto ignition temperature etc.
- Pumps having high criticality with respect to reliability and availability. Non availability of the pump would result into significant production loss. Examples of such pumps are High pressure Coke cutting pumps, Boiler Feed Water pumps, Coker charge pumps, etc.

#### **B. Non API pumps:**

Non API pumps should be selected for the following applications /conditions:

![](_page_51_Picture_0.jpeg)

- Centrifugal Pumps in non-critical services in chemical plants.
- Cooling tower pumps, DM plants, Fire Water, Sea Water, Waste water treatment applications, Fresh water, Desalination process pumps, Reverse Osmosis plant, Sodium Carbonate, Chemical effluents (Mixture of Alkaline & Acidic Liquids), etc.

### **C. Specially engineered pumps:**

These pumps should be selected from standard and proven designs of vendors who have designed and developed these pumps for specific applications. Examples of such services are PTA slurry, FCCU column bottoms pumps, Coker plant Recirculation pumps, Coker Maze pit pump, etc.

Specially engineered pumps should be selected for the following service / condition:

- Services which require additional engineering inputs other than those in API specifications. Examples of such pumps are Coker Charge pumps with special features like auger type coke crusher etc.).
- Pumps in slurry applications. If the content of solid particles exceeds 20% by Volume, then the pumps should be designed as "Slurry Pumps".

#### **D. Seal-less pumps**

Seal-less Centrifugal pumps should be selected for services where absolute zero leakage from the shaft-casing interface is required, in view of safety considerations. Seal-less pumps can be either "canned motor pumps" or "magnetic drive pumps".

"Canned motor pumps" are used where safety of highest level is required and no leakage can be tolerated.

Typical seal-less pump services cover a broad range of fluids that include acids, alkalis, salts, corrosive fluids, esters, hydrocarbons, monomers, polymers, alcohols, ethers, halogens, nitrogen or sulfur compounds and even some extreme water conditions.

Seal-less pumps should conform to API 685.

Pumps will be normally unsheltered.

#### Start-up line and Recirculation line

For continuous duty pumps, the pump common suction line shall be sized for flows corresponding to all the pumps in operation to facilitate online testing of the standby pump without disturbing the process flow.

### Minimum recirculation line

All pumps to have start up bypass through restriction orifice for testing.

![](_page_52_Picture_0.jpeg)

- If driver motor power is greater than 50 HP, control valve with controller shall be used.
- If driver motor power is less than 50 HP, orifice shall be used.
- For low capacity pumps, this may be reviewed case to case basis.

### Prevention of back flow overpressure:

- P lower than or equal 40 kg/cm2 g: one check valve.
- P higher than 40 kg/cm2 g and smaller than 80 kg/cm2 g: two check valves of different type (stem or shaft blow out resistant, preferably of the nonslamming type).
- P higher than or equal 80 kg/cm2 g: two check valves of different type (stem or shaft blow out resistant, preferably of the non-slamming type) plus an automatic shut-off valve in case of low flow.

#### Motor Ratings

Motors shall have power ratings including the service factor, if any, as below:

- For pumps with rated power < 22KW, motors shall be sized for at least 125% of the rated power requirement.
- For pumps with rated power equal to or greater than 22 KW, the following guidelines shall be followed:
  - o For parallel operation, motor power shall at least equal to "end of curve" power requirement of the pump, or 115% of the pump power at rated conditions, whichever is greater.

### **9.7.8.3 Compressors**

Equipment design shall be based on final material balances with agreed overdesign margins. Physical properties used must have been validated.

#### Mechanical design

![](_page_53_Picture_0.jpeg)

Centrifugal and Axial compressors shall conform to API Standard 617.

# **10 Safety, health and environment related requirements**

### **10.1 Hazardous properties of Chemicals**

Reliance has standardised Globally Harmonized System of compiling and reporting the hazardous properties of chemicals. The same practice shall be adopted for all projects. For many common chemicals, Reliance is in a position to extract the data from already compiled database and the same cane be adopted for project with requisite verification by licensor / BEC.

### **10.2 Chemical Chemical Interaction Matrix**

Reliance requires Licensor / BEC and later DEC also to compile and present detailed chemical chemical interaction matrix. The service list needs to include all utilities, small quantity chemicals and atmospheric air. Standard risks associated with fire, explosion, various chemical reactions, toxicity and others shall be highlighted.

Reliance has developed such matrices for all manufacturing installations and these can cover most of the chemical chemical interactions foreseen for various projects.

#### **10.3 Chemical Metal Interaction Matrix**

Licensor / BEC / DEC and Vendors shall take cognizance of all normal operation Chemical Metal Interactions. This information shall be compiled and formalised in a matrix form and shall. Material Selection Diagram at basic design stage and actual metallurgy selection by DEC and Vendors shall be guided by the Chemical Metal Interaction Matrix.

### **10.4 Management of highly toxic materials**

Licensor / BEC / DEC and vendors shall be guided by Reliance Safety Standards about management of highly toxic materials. This document provides list of highly toxic materials and specific recommendations on handling and storing of these.

### **10.5 Inherently safer process design approaches**

Reliance plans to progressively adopt inherently safer process design approaches. These will follow principles of Elimination, Substitution, Inventory reduction and Process

![](_page_58_Picture_0.jpeg)

intensification and Moderation. Licensor and BEC are required to actively utilize such principles without compromising the design objectives of the plant. At the simplest level, this can be a check-list based audit that can identify safer options.

At a more comprehensive level, more formal tools can be used where the risks justify use of detailed methodology.

### **10.6 Hazard identification**

Reliance is adopting semi-quantitative methods of identifying and categorizing process hazards based on computation of various indices.

Some typical indices are Dow Fire & Explosion index, Chemical Exposure Index, Mond Index, Safety and Health Index and several others. It is required that Licensor / BEC / Vendor carry out such analysis for the process plants.

### **10.7 HAZOPS**

HAZOPS are required for all the new facilities at Reliance including all packages. All the inter- connections with existing facilities are to be studied critically, identifying the potential impacts of incidents at either end of the interconnects.

HAZOPS shall take cognizance of GHS format data, Chemical Chemical Interaction Matrix data, Chemical Metal Interaction Matrix data, Hazard identification studies. HAZOPS shall use a Risk Assessment Matrix advised by Reliance. It is required that this be uniform across all projects for a leadership team to moderate the recommendations conveniently and quickly.

For technologies that are relatively new to Reliance, HAZOPS or similar studies shall be carried out at Licensor's / BEC's premises during evolution of Basis engineering design.

This is in addition to HAZOPS to be carried out during detail engineering. For rest of the units, one HAZOPS at DEC's premises, with 30 to 40% progress in engineering shall suffice.

Package vendors shall carry out HAZOPS following same guidelines, practices and work instructions. PMT shall ensure compliance through respective DEC's.

All HAZOPS recommendations shall be reviewed by a leadership tem for moderation and the approved changes shall be tracked for implementation.

![](_page_59_Picture_0.jpeg)

### **10.8 SIL Assessment studies**

HAZOPS at Licensor's / BEC's premises shall be followed by a SIL Assessment study. For such study, it is convenient to have the ESD systems defined.

If this exercise is not complete during Basic engineering, the SIL Assessment study shall be carried out at DEC's premises once the first pass ESD definition is complete.

As in case of HAZOPS, a leadership team shall moderate the SIL Assessment recommendations and shortlist the ones to be implemented. These shall be tracked and liquidated by respective DEC's and Vendors. PMT shall ensure compliance.

### **10.9 Risk Analysis**

Quantitative Risk analysis shall be carried out for facility siting and development of overall plot plan. For this purpose, PHAST, PHASTRISK and equivalent software shall be utilized. Risk shall be analysed for major single events in isolation.

IR shall be calculated for most exposed (to process risk) employees and computed IR shall be compared with Policy IR. Licensor / BEC shall advise failure data to be utilized for QRA based on their experience. The ALARP principle shall be adopted in making choices about risk mitigation measures.

#### **10.10 Development of plot plan**

Special recommendations from Licensor, if any, are to be incorporated for development of Unit layout and Overall plot plan as relevant. The plot plan shall follow norms / guidelines of latest issue of Oil Industry Safety Directorate as a minimum. Depending on the capacities of plants involved, it would be advisable for the J3 project team to refer to guidelines available from IRI, GE Gap 2.5.2 and such others. Optimum spacing will be provided for ease of Operation / Maintenance for critical equipment layout. Area classification requirements as per relevant Indian Standard must be followed.

Over and above, Maximum Consequence Analysis results and QRA results shall be taken in consideration while developing the overall plot plan.

### **10.10.1 Baseline data for pollutants and dispersion modeling**

MOEF has stipulated maximum ground level concentrations of various chemicals that can be allowed for a location. These have been fixed based on the effect of these chemicals on health of human beings and in some cases on flora and fauna.

![](_page_60_Picture_0.jpeg)

For the J3 project sites, baseline data on GLCs shall be available through a separate study. For all new potential emissions, dispersion analysis shall be carried out initially for project clearance, (beyond RPMG scope) and later in course of detail engineering. This study can have impacts on the locations of individual stacks and hence on the overall plot plan.

| RELIANCE | 1. Preliminary battery limit information available from various process units have been studied. The numbers in this document, though preliminary, do not appear to have disconnects with process unit requirements.                                                                                                                                                  |                   |                                    |                       |                        |            |  |  |  |  |  |
|          | 2. The numbers reported are mostly actual plant typical numbers from DTA and SEZ refineries, that have got established due to a) source conditions as indicated and b) existing distribution networks in the refineries. OSBL designer shall ensure that these numbers are satisfied for J3. Changes will be made only where inevitable, with the concurrence of RIL. |                   |                                    |                       |                        |            |  |  |  |  |  |
